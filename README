README for MITTENS
==================

For the most part, MITTENS is just big group of IDL *.pro files that can be used for poking around in MEarth data. To use these tools, you will need to download the source from https://bitbucket.org/zberta/mearth-tools/, store them somewhere, and add that directory to your IDL_PATH environment variable by adding a line that looks something like

# =======================================================================
#  MEarth IDL Tools for Transits of Extrasolar Neptunes and Super-earths
# =======================================================================

# sets the directory where are all data (reprocessed LC's, search results, etc...) will be stored
setenv MITTENS_DATA /pool/eddie1/zberta/mearth_data/

# set the PATH to the MITTENS routines, and add it to the IDL PATH
setenv MITTENS_PATH ~/idl_routines/zkb/mearth-tools
setenv IDL_PATH +{$MITTENS_PATH}:{$IDL_PATH}

# define an alias, so you can type "mittens" from the UNIX prompt
alias mittens "idl mearth.pro"

# the next two lines are needed to allow IDL to access the database
setenv IDL_DLM_PATH /data/mearth1/db/idl:+~/idl_routines/galloy/idldoc
setenv PGSERVICE mearth

# =======================================================================


These tools will allow you to run the analysis pipeline (takes a long time, and best run inside a VNC window so you don't have to watch it) and explore the data and results with interactive data visualization tools.
